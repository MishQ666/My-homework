## **Overview and Origin** 
---
>' If you belive something needs to exist, if it's something you want use yourself, don't let anyone ever stop you from doing it."--Tobias Lütke


[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com.au/)was founded by Tobias Lütke who met his wife Fiona in Canada on a snowboarding trip, and in 2002 moved to Ottawa to be with her. Without a degree, he couldn’t get a work permit, but could start a company, so launched an online snowboard shop, Snowdevil. 


While building the site for his newly set up snowboard shop in 2006, he struggled to find the ideal software that showcases the product for the snowboarding enthusiasts.After spending 16 hours a day programming and self-studying an open source language called Ruby, he has launched Snowdevil 10 weeks later. 


Lütke  soon started to get more enquiries about his site than his snowboards, people wanting to license his software.

Lütke and his partner Scott Lake each put $20,000 into the business, and Shopify now supports over 1.6 million websites in 175 countries, and handled over $120 billion in sales during 2020. 


## **Business Activities**
---
It helps one million companies in more than 175 countries to build and run online stores, from Kylie Jenner’s cosmetics business to fast-growing millennial sportswear brand Gymshark and the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew.

Its own revenue grew 86% to $2.9 billion over the last 12 months, and its market capitalisation from $46 to $137 billion in one year, making it Canada’s most valuable company in 2020. 

Unlike a lot of companies, Shopify was incentivized not just to sell their product to customers, but also to help customers become more successful on the platform. The more money customers made, the more money Shopify made.

This drove Shopify to help their users become better merchants, and that’s the biggest reason they’ve grown to where they are today.

## **Landscape**
---
Due to coronavirus, it has pulled forward the launch of new tools and created others from scratch to equip fledgling startups to weather the storm.

Services include new finance functions to help manage cash flow, but also in-store pick-up and delivery optionsThis is essentially Shopify’s foray into home delivery. It already has a small team working full-time on grocery, underlining the extent of its ambitions, and indeed its speed, as it challenges incumbents like Amazon, eBay and even Walmart on more fronts. While Shopify is not in charge of deliveries itself, it is currently building a depot and logistics network after it paid US$450 million for a warehouse robotics firm last year.
