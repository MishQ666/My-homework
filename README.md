## **Overview and Origin** 
---
>' If you belive something needs to exist, if it's something you want use yourself, don't let anyone ever stop you from doing it."--Tobias Lütke


[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com.au/)was founded by Tobias Lütke who met his wife Fiona in Canada on a snowboarding trip, and in 2002 moved to Ottawa to be with her. Without a degree, he couldn’t get a work permit, but could start a company, so launched an online snowboard shop, Snowdevil. 


While building the site for his newly set up snowboard shop in 2006, he struggled to find the ideal software that showcases the product for the snowboarding enthusiasts.After spending 16 hours a day programming and self-studying an open source language called Ruby, he has launched Snowdevil 10 weeks later. 


Lütke  soon started to get more enquiries about his site than his snowboards, people wanting to license his software.

Lütke and his partner Scott Lake each put $20,000 into the business, and Shopify now supports over 1.6 million websites in 175 countries, and handled over $120 billion in sales during 2020. 


## **Business Activities**
---
Shopify is an ecommerce platform that business owners can use to build their stores both online and offline. 

The intended customers are small and medium-sized businesses. It helps one million companies in more than 175 countries to build and run online stores, from Kylie Jenner’s cosmetics business to fast-growing millennial sportswear brand Gymshark and the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew.

Shopify Has Nearly 11 Percent of the Total E-Commerce Market Share (Statista) Although WooCommerce has the largest e-commerce market share at 28.24 percent and Squarespace is second at 17.69 percent, Shopify is firmly positioned in third at 10.98 percent.

Unlike a lot of companies, Shopify was incentivized not just to sell their product to customers, but also to help customers become more successful on the platform. The more money customers made, the more money Shopify made.

This drove Shopify to help their users become better merchants, and that’s the biggest reason they’ve grown to where they are today.


Ruby on Rails is a pillar of Shopify's core application, as well as Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Liquid. For affiliate marketing, you can use Refersion. For conversion optimization, Shopify syncs with Justuno, LimeSpot, Privy, and Nosto. There is Loop and Returnly for managing returns and exchanges.



## **Landscape**
---

Shopify is one of the leading Technology enablers, who tailors clients needs to its core. 

Shopify was one of the first to foresee the omni-channel trend that is disrupting product-based businesses.  Shopify (and Square) was one of the first to take advantage of this trend and became the “one-stop-shop” for omni-channel retailers as it connected seamlessly with all their online/offline sales channels synching their cross-channel inventory and providing omni-channel insights. This resolved a lot of complications associated with being omni-channel. 

Due to coronavirus, it has pulled forward the launch of new tools and created others from scratch to equip fledgling startups to weather the storm.

Services include new finance functions to help manage cash flow, but also in-store pick-up and delivery options. This is essentially Shopify’s foray into home delivery. It already has a small team working full-time on grocery, underlining the extent of its ambitions, and indeed its speed, as it challenges incumbents like Amazon, eBay and even Walmart on more fronts. While Shopify is not in charge of deliveries itself, it is currently building a depot and logistics network after it paid US$450 million for a warehouse robotics firm last year.

## **Results**
---

Shopify has managed to challenge Amazon not by going head to head, but by empowering small retailers and entrepreneurs to take control over their businesses. By removing technical barriers through the provision of affordable and user friendly plugins, Shopify allowed SMBs to go direct to consumer and to build their own brands removing their dependence on a marketplace like Amazon. Solving SMBs’ operational pain points is a great value proposition, but definitely not a winning one as a lot of other companies were offering similar services to SMBs at the time 
From the very humble beginning of the . Shopify has now turned into a platform that hosts over $325,000 shops for individual sellers that generates over $20million in revenue every month.

## **Reccommendations**
---
1. Deliery tracking system

This allows business owners and their customers to complete the transaction using same platform which saves time. Technologies utlised includes machine learning for warehouse robots, cryptocurrency acceptance for payment, and blockchain for tracking of delivery  

2. Machine Leanring for business overdrafts
Machine Learning allows Shopify to identify eligible merchants based on its sales history, cash reserve estimation, and store performance. This is an opportunity to offer pre-approved lending faiclities that helps business's short term cash flow. 

3. Big data for price setting and daily operations 
Profit margin and price setting are usually the key of any business success. Extracting big data to predict cost of goods sold, average purchase value, number of customers, conversion rate etc. can help busiess to determine their stock level in need, cost cutting strategies and setting target price.
